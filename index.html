          <p class="info">
            Mr. Burns is my name and I am a wise and old person who provides power to so many people in my town that I love to call springfield! 
            Without my powerplant the people of springfield would have to find other means of power. 
            I also have many other ventures that I love to do. I aboslutely love to have my hand in anything that I can control.
